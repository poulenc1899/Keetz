# Keetz: A Points of Interest (POI) Mapping Application

Keetz is a web application that allows users to explore and learn about various points of interest (POIs) on a map. The application is built using React and leverages Google Maps API for map rendering and POI data.

## Features

- **Explore POIs**: Users can explore various POIs on the map. Each POI is represented by a marker on the map.
- **POI Details**: Clicking on a POI marker navigates the user to a detailed view of the POI, including its description and location on the map.
- **Back Navigation**: Users can navigate back to the map view from the POI details view.- **Create a map of your own points of interest**: Users can create a map with their own points of interest. This includes the ability to search for locations by name, add locations to a list, add a title and description to the location, auto-fill the title and description, name the map, describe the map, and customize the page theme. Users can also add custom ratings, choosing up to 5 awards for each location.
- **Share the map with your friends**: Users can share their custom map with friends. This includes no-login sharing, unique link generation, and the ability to share editing rights via the link.
- **Export the map to your favourite map service**: Users can export their custom map to Google Maps or Apple Maps.
- **Import map from your favourite map service**: Users can import a map from Google Maps.

## Backend Tasks

- **Fix CORS permissions**: The CORS permissions need to be fixed so that the application works on both localhost and IP address.
